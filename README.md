# EncodeDecode
A simple java program that takes in a string of length 26 and uses it to either encode or decode a second input.
There are 2 text boxes and 2 buttons. The first text box takes in the 26 character string and uses that as a sort of modified alphabet.
If the first letter in the alphabet is "x" then all "a"s will become an "x" when encoded and all "x"s will become "a"s when decoded.
The second text box takes in the string to be either encoded or decoded. 
The encode button is used to take a string in normal alphabet and swap the letters for the corresponding letters in the modified one.
The decode button is used to take a string in modified alphabet and put it into normal alphabet.
The result will be displayed in a label at the bottom.
